### Inbox App 

1. The app shows all the messages in the inbox 
2. If you flag the message, then the message count increases the flag count.
3. If you unflag the message, then the message count decreases the flag count. Similar approach is used for read/unread messages. 
4. If you delete the message, the delete count is increased. 
5. If you read the messages, the message is unbolded. 
6. You can also move to flagged and inbox message section.
